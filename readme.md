##### this is the answer for project 3 exercise 1
exercise 1:

simpledb.Parser.handleQueryStatement():
* Get a logical plan from SQL parser by calling parseQueryLogicalPlan.
* Get a physical plan base on previous logical plan.

simpledb.Parser.parseQueryLogicalPlan():
* Iterate through from clause and set table name & alias in logical plan.
* Deal with where clause. Determine a join or filter on types of operands of a operator 
and make corresponding sub node in logical plan.
* Extract group by a field.
* Iterate through select clause and add projection fields to logical plan. If an aggregate is encountered, extract field id and store infos in logical plan.
* If there is an order by clause, extract and add the field and ASC/DESC order in logical plan.

simpledb.LogicalPlan.physicalPlan():
* Iterate through base tables and 
    - make a sequential scan for each table alias.
    - make an entry of table statistics
    - make an entry of filter selectivity  
* Iterate through filters of this logical plan  
    - convert filter info into a predicate for execution usage
    - compute selectivity of the table on value specified in filter
    - update selectivity of the used table by multiple up with original one
* Iterate through query plan which is generated by join optimizer
    - use the two iterators in logical plan node to construct join operator
    - substitute the sub plan on the left hand side with the new join operator
    - remove right hand side operator if it's not a sub query 
* Iterate through select list
    - if it's an aggregate operation, add an int field in output fields
    - on aggregate but no operation, add an field that has "group by" param's type
    - add fields and their corresponding types if a 'null.*' wildcards shows up.
    - look up field id and type in tuple description and add them to output
* Makes aggregate node if needed
* Makes order by node if needed

how a physical plan is made in short:  
1. sequential scan(table access stage)    
2. filter and join (make a tree structure of operators)  
3. projection,aggregates and order by(deal with final output)  

##### Notes:
When catalog.txt and data.data is placed in project top level of folder. The command line can't read table file due to path issue.
Catalog.java used getParent to retrieve parent directory of catalog.txt if invoked by parser.
If parser gets a relative path without parent directory, the original code results in path that begins with 'null'.
A fix is to use no parent path if the return value is null.

##### Contest(Optional)

* Added an in-memory hash join for equal predicate.
It is similar to GRACE join but doesn't write out buckets as both hash tables fits in memory at the same time.


```sql
SELECT p.title
FROM papers p
WHERE p.title LIKE 'selectivity';

```
```
Started a new transaction tid = 2
Added scan of table p
Added select list field p.title
